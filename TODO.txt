=== Incomplete awlsim TODO list ===

S7 compatibility:
- ARRAYs in block interfaces
- STRUCTs
- User defined data types (UDT)
- Parsing of attributes
- POINTER and DB-pointer immediates
- ANY pointer
- Multiinstance

nice to have:
- Support for .awlpro in awlsimgui
- Throw an early error, if constant is assigned to FB/FC OUT/INOUT parameter.
