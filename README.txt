Awlsim is a free Step 7 compatible AWL/STL Soft-PLC written in Python.

Depending on the host machine and the Python interpreter used, it achieves
good performance of several thousand to millions of AWL/STL instructions
per second. German and english AWL/STL mnemonics are supported.

Awlsim can emulate CPUs with two and four accumulator registers (S7-3xx and
S7-4xx).

Compatibility to S7 hardware is taken seriously by the awlsim project. We want
to be as close as possible to the real PLC hardware with our AWL/STL code
execution. For this reason awlsim ships an extensive selftest suite. Missing
features and differences between awlsim and Step 7 are documented in the
COMPATIBILITY.txt and TODO.txt files. If you find any undocumented bugs and
incompatibilities to a real PLC CPU, please contact us.

Awlsim is Open Source Free Software licensed under the GNU General Public
License v2+. That means it's available in full source code and you are
encouraged to improve it and contribute your changes back to the community.
Awlsim is free of charge, too.
